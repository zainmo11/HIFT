# SiamBAN Network Video Inference

This repository contains code for performing real-time video inference using a SiamBAN network. The provided example showcases how to integrate a SiamBAN model with video capture to make predictions on individual frames.

## Overview

The SiamBAN network is a placeholder model for demonstration purposes. You should replace the provided network architecture with the actual SiamBAN implementation. This code demonstrates how to:
- Load a pre-trained SiamBAN model
- Process video frames
- Run inference on each frame
- Display predictions in real-time

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- torchvision

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python
```
## Usage
### Prepare Your Model:

Replace the SiamBANNetwork class with the actual SiamBAN model architecture. Ensure that your model is trained and the weights are saved in a file named model.pth.

### Prepare Your Video:

Place your video file (e.g., video.mp4) in the working directory or specify the path to your video file in the code.

### Run the Inference Script:

#### Execute the script using Python:
```bash
python inference.py
```
The script will open the specified video file, process each frame, run inference using the SiamBAN model, and display the prediction on each frame.

## Code Description
- SiamBANNetwork: Placeholder for the SiamBAN model. Replace with the actual SiamBAN architecture.
- load_model(model_path): Loads the pre-trained model from the specified file path.
- preprocess_image(image): Preprocesses video frames to match the input requirements of the model.
- postprocess_output(output): Post-processes the model's output to get the final prediction.
- main(): Main function to load the model, capture video frames, perform inference, and display results.
## Notes
Adjust the model architecture, input preprocessing, and output postprocessing based on the specific requirements of the SiamBAN network you are using.
Ensure that the model file (model.pth) and video file (video.mp4) are correctly specified and located in the working directory.
